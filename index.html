                Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to<br> think of a good headline for your email, website or product... but nothing<br> really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just skip that?

                This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for<br> our own projects. We were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a<br> blank screen, unable to come up with any headlines, titles or subject lines.

                We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got<br> amazing results. Some headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!

                Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we<br> could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines with them.<br> We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some <span>very positive</span><br> results with these headlines as well.<br>
                <br> 
                They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make.<br> This success inspired us to share our collection of <span>200 headlines</span> with<br> everyone.
